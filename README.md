# WELCOME TO THE CODESMITH PRECOURSE!!! 

## Please Read Everything Before Proceeding...

Welcome To The Codesmith Precourse

The precourse is designed to help you become experience in the fundamental javascript concepts. Much of the challenges may be familiar, especially in the first portiosn but please be patient since a big end project awaits where you will utilize all your javascript skills to create an "Instagram" clone in part 2 of the precourse. We aspire you to be proficient in your javascript skills and become a better programmer through the process.

This precourse will truly help you understand the core material and get you ready for our fulltime program. Plus, it is a great opportunity for you to show us that you can handle our rigorous curriculum.

If this is challenging, don't be worrried! Getting used to the challenge will be a great asset for you in our program.

## You Need To Know How To Use GitHub!

It is really important that you get familiar with github. We will provide you with all the challenges through github and you will be submitting your completed work to use through github. The way we use github is slightly different so make sure you read the "GitHub.md" file to get yourself familiar with the processes. Also, github is very popular among well-known companies and knowing how to use it will undoubtedly be a great skill for you in the future.

## Instructions For The Precourse Challenges:

We divided the precourse challenges into six different units. Each unit has its own folder. Each folder consists of four items:

- Instructions File ("README.md")
- Source Folder ("src")
- Test Folder ("test")
- Index File ("index.html")

Please read the instructions ("README.md") file before attempting any of the challenges. You will only modify the codes inside the "main.js" file located in the source ("src") folder; make sure to read the comments inside the "main.js" file. DO NOT CHANGE anything in any other files or folders. You may take a look at the test folder to inquire how we are testing the correctness of the challenges. After you are done with each challenge open the index file (index.html) on the browser (Chrome or Firefox) to display the test results. For incorrect result, a red "x mark" will display beside thine test that did not pass and for correct result, a green "check mark" will display bside the test that passed. We encourage you to look at the displayed error message; it will help you figure out what you might need to fix.
