# WELCOME TO THE PRECOURSE!!!

## Please Read Everything Before Proceeding...

Welcome To Codesmith Precourse.

The precourse is designed to help you become experienced in the fundamental javascript concepts. Much of the challenges may be familiar, especially in the first portion but please be patient since a big end project awaits where you will utilize all your javascript skills to build come interesting projects. Part 1 of the precourse is designed to solidify your basics in javascript. In part 2 of the precourse, you will be doing more javascript challenges while building an "Instagram" clone and a copy of the "Google" page. Part 3 of the precourse is equipped with a JSON parser and exposure to javascript frameworks. We aspire you to be proficient in your javascript skills and become a better programmer through the process.

This precourse will truly help you understand the core material and get you ready for our fulltime program. Plus, it is a great opportunity for you to show us that you can handle our rigorous curriculum.

If this is challenging, don't be worrried! Getting used to the challenge will be a great asset to you in our program.

## You Need To Learn The Command Line

Still using the Windows Explorer or Mac Finder? These tools have a graphical interface (pictures of folders and files). However, many of the tools you'll use as a developer lack a nice graphical user interface (GUI). In order to use them, you'll need to be familiar with the command line. This is a manamgement interface using only text. Don't worry! Once you get used to it, you'll find it makes your life much easier. You can use any resources you like. We recommend reading these.

## You Need To Know How To Use GitHub!

It is really important that you get familiar with github. We will provide you with all the challenges through github and you will be submitting your completed work to use through github. The way we use github is slightly different so make sure you read the ["GitHub.md"](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-JSFundamentals/blob/master/GitHub.md) file to get yourself familiar with the processes. Also, github is very popular among well-known companies and knowing how to use it will undoubtedly be a great skill for you in the future. **YOU NEED TO FORK AND CLONE THIS REPO SO READ ["GitHub.md"](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-JSFundamentals/blob/master/GitHub.md) CAREFULLY TO LEARN HOW!**

## Instructions For The Precourse Challenges:

We divided part 1 of the precourse challenges into three different levels. Each level has its own folder. Each folder consists of four items (ignore any other files/folders or items you see):

- Skill Builder File ("README.md")
- Source Folder ("src")
- Test Folder ("test")
- Index File ("index.html")

You will only modify the codes inside the "main.js" file located in the source ("src") folder. **MAKE SURE TO READ ALL COMMENTS** inside the "main.js" file; these will be your instructions for solving each problem. DO NOT CHANGE anything in any other files or folders. You may take a look at the test folder to inquire how we are testing the correctness of the challenges. After you are done with each challenge open the index file (index.html) on the browser (Chrome or Firefox) to display the test results. For incorrect result, a red "x mark" will display beside thine test that did not pass and for correct result, a green "check mark" will display bside the test that passed. We encourage you to look at the displayed error message; it will help you figure out what you might need to fix.

The Skill Builder File provides resources to instuct you on these challenges if needed. **Read the README files if you get stuck.**

#### Checkout The Skill Builders For Each Level:

- [Beginner Level](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-JSFundamentals/blob/master/Level%201%20(Beginner)/README.md)
- [Intermediate Level](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-JSFundamentals/blob/master/Level%202%20(Intermediate)/README.md)
- [Advanced Level](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-JSFundamentals/blob/master/Level%203%20(Advanced)/README.md)

## What do I do when I am done?

Please read the portion labelled **"What do I do when I am done with a unit?"** in the following link: [pushing to Github](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-JSFundamentals/blob/master/GitHub.md).

## Setting up Sublime Text (if you need to)

Code is just text - instructions for the computer written in plain text. Therefore we could write it in a simple text editor - but most people choose to a more sophisticated text editor - we'll use Sublime Text 2 - it's become the standard in software engineering. It gives us features like automatic highlighting of different JavaScript keywords, autocomplete of terms and automatic indentation of our code

Download Sublime Text 2:
