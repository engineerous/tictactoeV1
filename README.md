Welcome to the Codesmith Precourse

The precourse is designed to help you become experience in the fundamental javascript concepts. Much of the challenges may be familiar, especially in the first portiosn but please be patient since a big end project awaits where you will utilize all your javascript skills to create an "Instagram" clone in part 2 of the precourse.

If this is challenging, don't be worrried! Getting used to the challenge will be a great asset for you in our program.

## You need to know how to use GitHub

It is really important that you get familiar with github. We will provide you with all the challenges through github and you will be submitting your completed work to use through github. The way we use github is slightly different so make sure you read the "GitHub.md" file to get yourself familiar with the processes. Also, github is very popular among well-known companies and knowing how to use it will undoubtedly be a great skill for you in the future.
